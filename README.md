# Personal Addon Library for Godot

These are utility classes that I reuse with most of my addons. This repo is public for transparency with other plugin releases where the source files may not be present. This is not really for use by the public (though, that would be ok! MIT License).

They are meant to be used with my plugin exporter tool. They stay in this folder and are referenced by other plugins. When the exporter runs it creates a unique copy with all references updated for the plugin release package.
